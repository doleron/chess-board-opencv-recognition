# chess-board-opencv-recognition

Old strategy to recognises a chess board with OpenCV from 2015

In this approach I had used a mix of Canny and Hough lines to identify the square in the board. I no longer use this approach since the blob detection seemed to work better. Anyway, this approach worked better than Harris Corner Detection.
