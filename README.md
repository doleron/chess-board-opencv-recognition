# chess-board-opencv-recognition

Old strategy to recognises a chess board with OpenCV from 2015. I have first shared this code here: http://pastebin.com/UdRxX0EU

In this approach I had used a mix of Canny and Hough lines to identify the square in the board. I no longer use this approach since the blob detection seemed to work better. Anyway, this approach worked better than Harris Corner Detection.

There is a video on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2lCwh46SCI
